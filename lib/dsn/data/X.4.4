Unable to route

The mail system was unable to determine the next hop for the
message because the necessary routing information was
unavailable from the directory server.  This is useful for both
permanent and persistent transient errors.

A DNS lookup returning only an SOA (Start of Administration)
record for a domain name is one example of the unable to route
error.
