Too many recipients

More recipients were specified for the message than could have
been delivered by the protocol.  This error should normally
result in the segmentation of the message into two, the
remainder of the recipients to be delivered on a subsequent
delivery attempt.  It is included in this list in the event
that such segmentation is not possible.
