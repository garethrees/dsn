Conversion required but not supported

The message content must be converted in order to be forwarded
but such conversion is not possible or is not practical by a
host in the forwarding path.  This condition may result when an
ESMTP gateway supports 8bit transport but is not able to
downgrade the message to 7 bit as required for the next hop.
