Message Content or Media Status

The message content or media status codes report failures
involving the content of the message.  These codes report
failures due to translation, transcoding, or otherwise
unsupported message media.  Message content or media issues are
under the control of both the sender and the receiver, both of
which must support a common set of supported content-types.
