Security or Policy Status

The security or policy status codes report failures involving
policies such as per-recipient or per-host filtering and
cryptographic operations.  Security and policy status issues
are assumed to be under the control of either or both the
sender and recipient.  Both the sender and recipient must
permit the exchange of messages and arrange the exchange of
necessary keys and certificates for cryptographic operations.
